# BitcoinPrediction
Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency similar to dollars, euros, and yen. The difference is that instead of the backing of a nation or federal bank, it uses an online ledger with strong cryptography to secure online transactions. Through cryptocurrency exchanges, one can buy and sell cryptocurrencies. It can also be “mined.” The popularity of cryptocurrencies skyrocketed in 2017 as a result of several months of exponential growth in their market capitalization.
With increasing geopolitical and economic issues over the last two years, global currency values have fallen, stock markets have had a bad run, and investors have lost wealth. This has rekindled interest in digital currencies. Our system aids in cryptocurrency price prediction using machine learning.
Using machine learning, this program helps in forecasting cryptocurrency prices. In an effort to more accurately predict bitcoin prices quantitatively. In this system, the LSTM model is used to make predictions. The dataset used is from the last six years (2017 – 2022). Users can view predictions for three cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum, and the admin can view all users using this system.
This proposed system might be adequate to aid in price prediction, and try to maximize the predicting prices using machine learning to achieve better accuracy under all circumstances of technical trade indication, lowering its price prediction during evaluation.
